Eligible Players

- the "last two" rule:
  - if you submitted the last or second last post to a paper, you cannot claim
    it
- if the paper is invite-only, then only invitees can play
- if the paper is public and unrated, anybody can play
- if the paper is public and rated, only users with an adequete rating can play
  - you can specify the minimum rating
  - you cannot specify a minimum rating higher than your own rating

Rating

Finished public papers go to the gallery. When browsing the gallery,
authenticated users can "Like" a paper which gives everybody who submitted an
entry to it +1 rating.

As you improve your rating, you can make "pro only" games with only people
who have a high rating like you.
